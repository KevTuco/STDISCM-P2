Prerequisites:
- Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed. You can verify by running:
    dotnet --version

Steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project directory where your .csproj file is located.
   Example:
       cd C:\Path\To\P2_LookingforGroupSynchronization

3. Restore any necessary packages (if not already done):
       dotnet restore

4. Build the project:
       dotnet build
   - This compiles the source code and creates the necessary output files.

5. Run the project:
       dotnet run
   - The program will execute and read the "input.txt" file from the current directory.
     Make sure "input.txt" is present in the project folder.
